                <li>
                    <h2><a href="#">Class Project: <cite>Joust</cite> Game for CSSE220</a></h2>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/pac-joust.png" />
                    <p>
                        Two teammates and I built a game from scratch in Java, meant to mimic the gameplay
                        of the classic <cite>Joust</cite> arcade game. Over the span of two months,
                        we successfully built a working game with our own Pac-Man twist, involving
                        sound effects and numerous levels and enemies.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2><a href="#">Class Project: Processor and Architecture Design for CSSE232</a></h2>
                    <img src="images/portfolio/datapath.png" />
                    <p>
                        I worked with three teammates to design and create a unique processor
                        architecture from scratch. Using Xilinx ISE Design Suite, we wrote Verilog code
                        and performed extensive integration testing to complete a custom instruction set
                        capable of calculating relative prime numbers. Additionally, we wrote a fully detailed
                        design document to reflect the process and give insight on design and decisions.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2><a href="#">Class Project: "Sort My Professor" for CSSE333</a></h2>
                    <img src="images/retro.jpg" />
                    <p>
                        As a team of two, a classmate and I created a program similar to Rate My Professor,
                        but involving Harry Potter houses. We used MS SQL Server to create a database, and
                        developed a front-end GUI in Java that connected securely to the database. Users were
                        able to register or log in, add schools and professors to the database, and give
                        ratings. Based on survey answers, professors were then dynamically sorted into a
                        Hogwarts house and displayed for users to see.
